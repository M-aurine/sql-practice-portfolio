# SQL Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my SQL practice exercises using a makeshift **Employees** dataset.  
The goal is to strengthen SQL skills while simulating real-world HR analytics queries.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **Employees** table includes:
- `EmployeeID` → Unique identifier.  
- `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Gender`, `Age` → Personal details.  
- `Department`, `JobRole`, `EducationLevel` → Job attributes.  
- `YearsAtCompany`, `Salary` → Career details.  
- `Attrition` (`Yes`/`No`) → Employee turnover status.
